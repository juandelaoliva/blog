This is an example post showing how to implement FAQ schema markup.

## How to Use FAQ Schema

To use FAQ schema in your posts, simply add a `faq` array to your front matter like this:

```yaml
faq:
  - question: "Your question here?"
    answer: "Your answer here."
  - question: "Another question?"
    answer: "Another answer."
```

The FAQ schema will be automatically generated and included in the page's structured data.

## Benefits of FAQ Schema

- **Featured Snippets**: Your FAQs may appear in Google's featured snippets
- **Voice Search**: Better optimization for voice search queries
- **Rich Results**: Enhanced appearance in search results
