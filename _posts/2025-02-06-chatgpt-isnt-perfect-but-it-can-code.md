## The Problem: When AI Starts Acting Weird  

Yesterday, at the office, a colleague was trying to generate a list of unique identifiers using ChatGPT. At first, it seemed fine, but when he tried to generate **200 codes**, things started to break. The AI produced fewer than requested or behaved inconsistently.  

I saw his frustration and asked what he was trying to achieve. Turns out, he needed a structured list of codes but was relying on ChatGPT to generate them manually. **That’s where things usually go wrong.**  

## The Trick: Let ChatGPT Code for You 💡  

Instead of making AI do **repetitive, large-scale tasks**, it’s often smarter to use its **real strength—writing code to automate them.**  

I suggested a different approach:  

> **"Instead of asking ChatGPT to generate the codes directly, ask it to write a small JavaScript program that does it for you."**  

At first, he hesitated—ChatGPT had already given him a **Python** script, but he didn't know where to run it. So I recommended something even simpler:  

**"Ask ChatGPT to generate an HTML + JavaScript solution."**  

This way, he could run it directly in his browser or in [**CodePen**](https://codepen.io/) without installing anything. He tried it, and—boom!—it worked instantly.  


**📝 Tip:** If ChatGPT ever gives you code in a language you don’t know, just ask it to rewrite it in JavaScript. It’s one of the easiest to run and doesn’t require any setup.

## The Takeaway  

**ChatGPT is great, but not for large repetitive tasks.**  
Instead of relying on it to manually generate tons of data, use it to **write small automation scripts** for you.  

Next time you find yourself asking ChatGPT for a bulk task, ask yourself:  

> _**"Can I automate this instead?"**_  

Chances are, ChatGPT can write the code that will save you time—without the frustration.
