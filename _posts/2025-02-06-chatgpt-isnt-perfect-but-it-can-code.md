faq:
  - question: "Why does ChatGPT struggle with large repetitive tasks?"
    answer: "ChatGPT can become inconsistent when generating large amounts of data manually. It may produce fewer items than requested or behave unpredictably when asked to generate hundreds of similar items in one request."
  - question: "What's the better approach when working with ChatGPT for bulk tasks?"
    answer: "Instead of asking ChatGPT to generate data manually, ask it to write code that automates the task. This leverages AI's strength in coding rather than repetitive data generation."
  - question: "Why is JavaScript recommended for ChatGPT-generated automation?"
    answer: "JavaScript is recommended because it can run directly in a browser or CodePen without requiring any installation or setup, making it accessible even for users who don't know the language."
  - question: "What should you do if ChatGPT gives you code in a language you don't know?"
    answer: "Simply ask ChatGPT to rewrite the code in JavaScript. It's one of the easiest languages to run and doesn't require any setup or installation."
  - question: "How can you run ChatGPT-generated code without technical knowledge?"
    answer: "Use platforms like CodePen where you can paste HTML and JavaScript code and run it immediately in the browser, or ask ChatGPT to create an HTML + JavaScript solution that works directly in any web browser."
  - question: "What's the key lesson about using AI for productivity?"
    answer: "The key lesson is to use AI for what it's best at - writing code and automation - rather than for manual repetitive tasks. Always ask yourself 'Can I automate this instead?' when facing bulk tasks."

## The Problem: When AI Starts Acting Weird  

Yesterday, at the office, a colleague was trying to generate a list of unique identifiers using ChatGPT. At first, it seemed fine, but when he tried to generate **200 codes**, things started to break. The AI produced fewer than requested or behaved inconsistently.  

I saw his frustration and asked what he was trying to achieve. Turns out, he needed a structured list of codes but was relying on ChatGPT to generate them manually. **That’s where things usually go wrong.**  

## The Trick: Let ChatGPT Code for You 💡  

Instead of making AI do **repetitive, large-scale tasks**, it’s often smarter to use its **real strength—writing code to automate them.**  

I suggested a different approach:  

> **"Instead of asking ChatGPT to generate the codes directly, ask it to write a small JavaScript program that does it for you."**  

At first, he hesitated—ChatGPT had already given him a **Python** script, but he didn't know where to run it. So I recommended something even simpler:  

**"Ask ChatGPT to generate an HTML + JavaScript solution."**  

This way, he could run it directly in his browser or in [**CodePen**](https://codepen.io/) without installing anything. He tried it, and—boom!—it worked instantly.  


**📝 Tip:** If ChatGPT ever gives you code in a language you don’t know, just ask it to rewrite it in JavaScript. It’s one of the easiest to run and doesn’t require any setup.

## The Takeaway  

**ChatGPT is great, but not for large repetitive tasks.**  
Instead of relying on it to manually generate tons of data, use it to **write small automation scripts** for you.  

Next time you find yourself asking ChatGPT for a bulk task, ask yourself:  

> _**"Can I automate this instead?"**_  

Chances are, ChatGPT can write the code that will save you time—without the frustration.
