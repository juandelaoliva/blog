faq:
  - question: "Why is AI communication compared to an evil genie?"
    answer: "AI communication is like an evil genie because if you're not precise in your requests, you might get exactly what you asked for but not what you actually needed. The AI fills in gaps with its own logic, leading to unexpected results."
  - question: "What are the common SEO issues in multilingual Drupal sites?"
    answer: "Common issues include unsecured URLs (http instead of https), incorrect domains pointing to host providers, wrong language codes (like using /mx/ for Bolivia instead of /bo/), and inconsistent URL structures across markets."
  - question: "How can AI help with sitemap validation?"
    answer: "AI can automate the process of analyzing sitemaps across multiple markets by checking for protocol inconsistencies, verifying domain accuracy, ensuring correct language codes, and detecting errors in alias generation - tasks that would take hours manually."
  - question: "What's the key to effective AI communication?"
    answer: "The key is precision in defining your needs. The better you define your requirements, the better the result. Always be specific, add conditions, and account for edge cases to avoid AI filling gaps with its own logic."
  - question: "How long did it take to create the AI sitemap validation solution?"
    answer: "It took less than 30 minutes to refine the AI prompts and create a solution that could analyze sitemaps across multiple markets in minutes, compared to hours of manual work."
  - question: "What's the best way to give context to AI tools like ChatGPT?"
    answer: "Using voice recording (dictation) in ChatGPT is highly effective because it allows you to quickly provide a lot of context to the AI, making your requests more natural and comprehensive."

Managing SEO for a multimarket site is never easy, especially when dealing with over 30 markets, each with its own peculiarities. Recently, my team faced a sitemap issue in our Drupal setup that led to several problems, particularly in multilingual markets:

- **Unsecured URLs:** Some links used `http` instead of `https`.  
- **Incorrect domains:** URLs pointed to the host provider‚Äôs domain instead of the correct one.  
- **Wrong language codes:** Sitemaps mixed up country codes, like using `/mx/` for Bolivia instead of `/bo/`.

Once we thought the issue was fixed, the next step was testing. But with no QA resources available, the idea of manually checking all sitemaps‚Äîmarket by market‚Äîcame up. My response? **Why do it manually when AI can help?**

## AI: The Evil Genie in the Lamp  üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is where things got interesting. I decided to to to ChatGPT to help me with the task, and it worked great. But working with AI often **feels like making a wish to an evil genie**. If you don't phrase your request *just right*, you'll get exactly what you asked for... but probably not what you actually *needed*.

AI shines with precision. **The better you define your needs, the better the result**. If your request is missing details, the AI will fill in the gaps with its own logic and get unexpected or quite frustrating results. ü§Ø  

I found myself iterating again and again‚Äîrefining prompts, adding specific conditions, and accounting for every edge case. But once I nailed it (a little less than 30m), the AI-driven solution analyzed sitemaps across multiple markets in minutes, pinpointing issues that would have taken hours to find manually. üöÄ

**üìù Tip:** I personally love using the voice recording (dictation) option in ChatGPT because I can quickly give a lot of context to the AI.

## The Takeaway  

The real lesson here? Knowing how to **communicate effectively with AI** is an essential skill. Whether you're automating processes, optimizing workflows, or simply trying to get reliable results‚Äîprecision in defining your needs is crucial.  

So, the next time you‚Äôre facing a tedious task, take a step back and ask yourself: ***Am I asking the right questions?*** If not, AI might just grant your wish... with a few surprises you didn‚Äôt see coming.

## Cracking the Code with AI üíª

The process involved using a simple yet effective approach:  
1. Extracting and analyzing URLs from the sitemap.  
2. Checking for protocol inconsistencies (`http` instead of `https`).  
3. Verifying domain accuracy based on the market.  
4. Ensuring correct language codes in URLs.  
5. Checking how percentaje of URLS has a numeric path (detect errors on alias generation)

Once I defined these checks clearly and structured my AI prompts correctly, I had a tool that could scan dozens of pages and produce results in no time.
