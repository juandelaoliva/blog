Managing SEO for a multimarket site is never easy‚Äîespecially when dealing with over 30 markets, each with its own quirks. Recently, my team faced a sitemap issue in our Drupal setup that led to several problems, particularly in multilingual markets:

- **Unsecured URLs:** Some links used `http` instead of `https`.  
- **Incorrect domains:** URLs pointed to the host provider‚Äôs domain instead of the correct one.  
- **Wrong language codes:** Sitemaps mixed up country codes, like using `/mx/` for Bolivia instead of `/bo/`.

Once we thought the issue was fixed, the next step was testing. But with no QA resources available, the idea of manually checking all sitemaps‚Äîmarket by market‚Äîcame up. My response? **Why do it manually when AI can help?**

## AI: The Evil Genie in the Lamp  

This is where things got interesting. I decided to turn to the AI to help me with the task, and it worked great. But working with AI often **feels like making a wish to an evil genie**. If you don't phrase your request *just right*, you'll get exactly what you asked for... but probably not what you actually *needed*.

AI shines with precision. **The better you define your needs, the better the result**. If your request is missing details, the AI will fill in the gaps with its own logic and get unexpected or downright frustrating results.  

I found myself iterating again and again‚Äîrefining prompts, adding specific conditions, and accounting for every edge case. But once I nailed it, the AI-driven solution analyzed sitemaps across multiple markets in minutes, pinpointing issues that would have taken hours to find manually.

**üìù Tip:** I personally love using the voice recording (dictation) option in ChatGPT because I can quickly give a lot of context to the AI.

## The Takeaway  

The real lesson here? Knowing how to **communicate effectively with AI** is an essential skill. Whether you're automating processes, optimizing workflows, or simply trying to get reliable results‚Äîprecision in defining your needs is crucial.  

So, the next time you‚Äôre facing a tedious task, take a step back and ask yourself: ***Am I asking the right questions?*** If not, AI might just grant your wish... with a few surprises you didn‚Äôt see coming.

## Cracking the Code with AI  

The process involved using a simple yet effective approach:  
1. Extracting and analyzing URLs from the sitemap.  
2. Checking for protocol inconsistencies (`http` instead of `https`).  
3. Verifying domain accuracy based on the market.  
4. Ensuring correct language codes in URLs.  

Once I defined these checks clearly and structured my AI prompts correctly, I had a tool that could scan dozens of pages and produce results in no time.
